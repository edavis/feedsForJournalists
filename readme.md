# Feeds for Journalists

An open source project to create a great list of feeds for journalists to follow.

## Intro

Yesterday Mathew Ingram, a longtime friend and professional journalist, put out a <a href="https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/952214692918734848">call for feeds</a> for a reboot of his use of RSS. This got me thinking. What if a community created such a list of feeds, and did it over a period of weeks or months, with discussion, and a certain amount of deliberation. 

We could use the tools of open source to do this project.  

That's what this repository is for, it's a place where we can work on a list of feeds. 

## Getting started

Here's the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists/blob/master/list.txt">actual list</a>. 

I'll write a small piece of software that periodically turns that collection into an OPML file suitable for use in a feed reader. 

From there who knows what happens, but just getting a list of feeds for journalists to follow, collaboratively, while it doesn't involve much work or technical know-how, would be a major improvement over the way we all do this for ourselves. 

## MIT License

I've set up this work with the most liberal open source license. This project can be forked, competed with, repurposed, with or without credit. Do with it as you please.

## Criteria for feeds

I suggest we use the same criteria for including feeds that most of us use for pushing links to our followers on social media and through  linkblogs. 

A feed is included not because we agree or disagree, all its inclusion means is we believe that an informed person would want to be aware of the perspective or information it provides. 

So while we may not be from Freedonia, we will recommend Freedonian news sources. We don't agree or disagree. 

## How the list works

If you know how to do a <a href="https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/">pull request</a>, simply make the changes you want to see, and submit the request.

But that can be overkill for a simple project like this one. 

You can also post an Issue <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists/issues/new">here</a>. It's pretty straightforward, I hope. Include links to the feed, or a link to a list of feeds. Let's see how this works. ;-)

I've started <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists/blob/master/list.txt">the list</a> with a small number of feeds I follow, to help seed the process.
